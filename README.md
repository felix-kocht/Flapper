# Flapper

The Flapper is a marine demonstrator, showing locomotion on water using two flapping hydrofoils, similar to a dolphins tail. This repo contains the arduino code for the Flapper, python scripts for communication with the Flapper and experiment scheduling and test result data. A corresponding scientific paper is currently in the review process and will be linked here, once public.

## Usage and File structure

- One folder for any part of the code (the 2 Controllers are PlatformIO projects, so get the VSCode extension to run them)
- the Visual Detector contains all Pyhton scripts for visual flap localisation (using April Tags) and experiment scheduling and Flapper communication.

For more detailed instructions on how to use the code refer to the Team Project Report, if obtainable, or contact me at felix.koch@mail.de
