## File structure

- folder for any part of the code (the 2 Controllers are PlatformIO projects (get the VSCode extension to run them))
- the Visual Detector ended up being all the Pyhton scripts but was not renamed due to compatibility
- For how to use the code refer to the Team Project Report or contact me at felix.koch@mail.de
